For my this project I decided to make a store where you can simulate simulate buying different kinds of Graphics cards.

In this project a user is required to create an account using a username and password. Once the user has created an account, the ability to view the store page and add items to the cart. there is a working test stripe functionality built into the site, which allows a mock sale along with purchase history unique to the account.

GP-You is a template for a store front. I wanted to build a site that could allow various types of products to be sold using this template. This emo site has Stripe built into it, allowing mock payments on the site.
